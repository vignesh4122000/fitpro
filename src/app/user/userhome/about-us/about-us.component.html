<p><span style="font-size: 20px">Fitpro began as a tech startup company, founded in October 2011 by five entrepreneurs who had survived the dot-com crash of the early 2000's. The startup was initially funded by private equity investor Ascent Capital (Bangalore) with a capital injection of $10 million.[8]

    By mid-2016, Fitpro was operating in eight large Indian cities and had grown to become India's biggest e-grocer.[8] The company's unique selling point was delivery of fresh produce, based on the purchase of fruit and vegetables from local marketplaces each morning, storage in refrigerated warehouses and a fleet of temperature-controlled trucks to deliver fresh to the door.[8]
    
    China's Alibaba Group led a $300 million funding round in early 2018 to become the main shareholder in the company,[2] taking the online grocer's valuation up to $950 million.[8] By May 2019, Big was operating across 25 Indian cities,[2] and became India's newest 'unicorn' (a startup valued at more than $1 billion) by raising $150 million in a new funding round led by Mirae Asset-Naver Asia Growth Fund, the CDC Group and Alibaba.[10]
    Basket
    The company was valued at around $1.85 billion in May 2021. Demand for online grocery shopping increased considerably in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and by the start of 2022, Fitpro was processing over 7 million orders per month.</span></p>
