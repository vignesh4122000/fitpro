<h1 style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: xx-large;">Ketogenic Diet:</h1>
<p style="font-size: larger;" >The ketogenic diet involves consuming a very low amount of carbohydrates and replacing them with fat to help your body burn fat for energy. Health  can include weight loss and lowering your risk for certain diseases.The ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and low carb diets.

    It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.
    
    When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain.
    
    Ketogenic diets can cause significant reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has some health benefits.

<h1 style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: xx-large;">Gluten-free diet:</h1>
<p style="font-size: larger;">A gluten-free diet is an eating plan that excludes foods containing gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and triticale (a cross between wheat and rye).A gluten-free diet is essential for managing signs and symptoms of celiac disease and other medical conditions associated with gluten.

    A gluten-free diet is also popular among people who haven't been diagnosed with a gluten-related medical condition. The claimed benefits of the diet are improved health, weight loss and increased energy, but more research is needed.Celiac disease is a condition in which gluten triggers immune system activity that damages the lining of the small intestine. Over time this damage prevents the absorption of nutrients from food. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder.
    Non-celiac gluten sensitivity causes some signs and symptoms associated with celiac disease — including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, "foggy brain," rash or headache — even though there is no damage to the tissues of the small intestine. Studies show that the immune system plays a role, but the process isn't well understood.</p>

<h1 style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: xx-large;">Mediterranean Diet:</h1>
<p style="font-size: larger;">The Mediterranean Diet emphasizes plant-based foods and healthy fats. You eat mostly veggies, fruits and whole grains. Olive oil is the main source of fat. Research shows the Mediterranean Diet can lower your risk of cardiovascular disease and many other chronic conditions. A dietitian can help you customize the diet to suit your individual needs.The Mediterranean diet is based on the traditional foods that people used to eat in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, including France, Spain, Greece, and Italy.

    Researchers noted that these people were exceptionally healthy and had a low risk of many chronic conditions.
    
    Although there are no strict rules or regulations for the diet, it typically encourages fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and heart-healthy fats. Processed foods, added sugar, and refined grains should be restricted.
    
    Numerous studies have now shown that the Mediterranean diet can promote weight loss and help prevent heart attacks, strokes, type 2 diabetes, and premature death.
    
    For this reason, the Mediterranean diet is often recommended for those looking to improve their health and protect against chronic disease.</p>
